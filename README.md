# Door_Key_Navigation_DP
This repository implements the 'Door &amp; Key Problem' using Dynamic Programming for autonomous navigation. It optimizes the path of a simulated agent in environments with dynamic obstacles, using Markov Decision Processes (MDP). The project showcases adaptability in both known and random environments for industrial robotics and autonomous vehicles.
