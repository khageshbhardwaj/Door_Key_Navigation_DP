# Door_Key_Navigation_DP
This repository implements the 'Door &amp; Key Problem' using Dynamic Programming for autonomous navigation. It optimizes the path of a simulated agent in environments with dynamic obstacles, using Markov Decision Processes (MDP). The project showcases adaptability in both known and random environments for industrial robotics and autonomous vehicles. 

# Door-Key Problem
This project focuses on finding the optimum policy given an environment. The project
is sub-divided into 2 parts; Part A with known environments and Part B with randomly generated environments.

Keep all the code in the starter code folder. Run the code [doorkey_PARTA.py] to check the optimum policy for part A and [doorkey_PartB.py] for part B. Code generates the last image (agent at goal location), a sequence of steps taken by the agent and an optimum policy.

# Part A
Here, we have organised all the known environments in a dictionary. Choose the number corresponding to an environment to find out its optimum policy. 

# Part B
Here, just run the code and an environment will be chosen at random. If the error comes, it means the number chosen lies outside the given domain and RERUN the program.

# requirements
All the requirements are listed out in the requirements.txt

# dependencies
import all the modules mentioned in the starting of the codes.
